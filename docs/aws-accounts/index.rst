AWS accounts
============

Each Rackspace account can house one or more AWS accounts. By default, you
can create up to five new AWS accounts through the
`Rackspace Technology Customer Portal <https://manage.rackspace.com/aws>`_.
If you need more than five accounts, open a ticket to request a
limit increase.  In addition to creating new AWS accounts, you can also
:ref:`transfer existing AWS accounts <transferring_existing_aws_accounts>`
to Rackspace for management.

Each AWS account provides a top-level administrative control boundary for the
resources that it contains. While you can leverage Amazon's Identity and Access
Management (IAM) platform to isolate certain resource access, we typically
recommend provisioning an AWS account per application deployment phase (such
as development, staging, and production). This provisioning allows
you to assign different users in your organization access to one or more
accounts without complex IAM policies. In this example, you could grant
developers access to provision EC2 instances, RDS databases, and so on in
your development and staging accounts and restrict them to read access for the
resources in your production account.

In addition to being a strong permission boundary, AWS accounts also provide a
convenient construct for tracking expenses because, by default, the system
groups both AWS and Rackspace charges by AWS account and can span multiple
accounts. For example, if you use four separate AWS accounts (**app1-dev**,
**app1-prod**, **app2-dev**, and **app2-prod**), you can easily see how much you
are spending on each application environment. We highly encourage you to use
tagging for more fine-grained expense tracking within accounts. However, tagging
is more complicated. You might miss tagging certain resources resulting in
unallocated cost, and not all AWS resource types support tagging. AWS accounts
provide a great default cost allocation construct.

Lastly, by using separate AWS accounts for each environment, you have the flexibility
to select different Rackspace :ref:`features <features>` for each
environment because Rackspace applies service levels at the AWS account
level.

As we describe later in this document, several FAWS
features (such as :ref:`Rackspace Logbook <logbook>`) are available in both
cross-account and account-specific views, enabling unified visibility across
multiple AWS accounts.
