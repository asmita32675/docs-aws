Optimizer+
----------

Optimizer+ (O+) builds on the Optimizer offering with additional service
enhancements. You still get the same great cost optimization services, and you
can still buy your support wherever you’d like. However, O+ layers on a few
additional services:

*	Architecture reviews
*	Planned event support
*	Basic VM monitoring


Architecture reviews
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rackspace Technology provides, at your request, an architecture review following
the best practices in your cloud of choice. We evaluate your security posture,
technological architecture, and use of cloud services, among other things. At the
end of that engagement, you get a report you can use to ensure your environment
is compliant with best practice recommendations.


Planned event support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Twice a year, Rackspace can help you to plan for and manage a large-scale event.
Commonly customers use this to help with events like Black Friday or their
*Shark Tank* moment. We evaluate your architecture, services utilization, and
resiliency to help you form a strategy to withstand the sudden spike in visitors
to your application.


Basic VM monitoring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As part of Optimizer+, we can set up a standard array of monitoring alerts for
your infrastructure based on the best practices of the cloud of your choice.
These alerts cover basic monitoring like instance performance checks, low disk
alerts, and domain health.  While we don’t respond to these alerts when they
fire, we gladly ensure we configured them to flow to the support team of your
choice.

.. _optimizer_platform:

  (involving specialized technical expertise from other functional groups or partner cloud teams).
* Escalate to a technology or service vendor in the event of an incident.
* Offer advice about the appropriate workaround to restore service.
* Provide customers the opportunity to confirm issue resolution before closing the ticket.
